## 2. Annapurna Circuit Trek: The Most Complete Kind of Variation, and Beauty

Another much-talked-about trek for its highly variant ecosystem—that allows us to taste strange culture, natural decor, artifice of nature, and finally, human. Annapurna region is the zone of authority over the whole Annapurna massif. At 8091m, and being the tenth highest mountain of the world, Annapurna I magnificently adorns the range.

### Why Go Trekking Through Annapurna Circuit?

- **Muktinath Temple**: Since the temple is perched at the area bordering the Thorong La Pass, it is regarded as a special shrine by all pilgrims on either side: Hindus and Buddhists alike. Quite in contrast to the cold serenity prevailing in the temple, the powerful backdrop scenery only enhances natural beauty.

- **Natural Hot Springs**: And, sometimes, the very strong winds from Annapurna Circuit carry some over to the village of Tatopani, famed for its hot springs. It feels so good soaking aching feet in warm hot springs after being battered by Mother Nature.

- **Sights Diversification**: The Annapurna Circuit caters to different terrains for the trekkers—from sub-tropical forest and alpine meadows to high-altitude desert. Such diversity in the landscape is going to mark the trekking as an ever-wonderful memory.

And there occurs another such perception running in parallel; in a way, some people consider Annapurna Circuit Trek an alternate shorter trekking option. Hence the website sits awkwardly on the Internet: all travel and accommodation arrangements made, with suggestions on what to do in-between.
